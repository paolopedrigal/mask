# mask
Still in development -- **COMING SOON!**

## Description
mask is a social media mobile application that treats social interactions as playing cards.
- User posts are _Cards_ where the background of the _Card_ could be a picture they would like to send with an overlaying caption
- Instead of scrolling through social media posts, users would have to swipe though a deck of _Cards_
- User profiles have _Hands_ which contain 7 hidden _Cards_ that only the user can see. If the user's friends decide to peek a _Hand_, the owner of the _Hand_ will be notified
- Friends can send each other _Anonymous Cards_, such that the receiver will not know who the sender is

### Technology used
- TypeScript, React Native, Expo
- React Navigation
- Redux Toolkit
- PostgreSQL, Supabase
